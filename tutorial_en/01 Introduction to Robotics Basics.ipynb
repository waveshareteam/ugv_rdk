    "## Control Architecture\n",
    "Our robot employs a master-slave architecture (akin to a brain-like structure), with the master unit potentially being a Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, Jetson Orin Nano, or other similar single-board computers equipped with a 40PIN interface. The slave unit utilizes an ESP32 to control the robot's peripherals, read sensor data, and manage closed-loop speed control for the motors using PID controllers. The master and slave units communicate through serial connections using JSON-formatted instructions."

    "\n",
    "1. The utilization of Jetson or other single-board computers as the primary processing unit for handling complex tasks, such as processing visual information, in conjunction with an ESP32 as a secondary controller dedicated to managing peripherals and sensors, exemplifies a modular design that enhances system flexibility and scalability. \n",
    "2. The single-board computers are tasked with higher-level processing and decision-making, while the ESP32 handles real-time, low-level tasks such as motor control. This division of labor allows each component to focus on its strengths, optimizing the system's overall performance.\n",
    "3. This architecture efficiently allocates processing power and I/O resources, reducing the strain on a singular system and enhancing efficiency. \n",
    "4. Communication between components is facilitated through serial connections using JSON, which not only streamlines data transfer but also improves readability, easing the debugging and expansion processes.\n",
    "5. For hobbyists and makers with limited budgets, this \"big-little\" architecture strategy offers a way to maintain high performance while minimizing costs and complexity of the system.ã€‚"

    "- Starting: When you open a Jupyter notebook, the associated Kernel will automatically start, indicated by a small green dot appearing in front of the corresponding note in the file list.\n",
    "- Restarting: If the Kernel crashes or you need to clear the current session's state, you can restart the Kernel via \"Kernel\" -> \"Restart Kernel...\".\n",
    "- Stopping: To stop the Kernel of a running note, go to \"Kernel\" -> \"Shut Down Kernel\" within the note interface. To stop all Kernels, use \"Kernel\" -> \"Shut Down All Kernels\".\n",
    "- Note: If a notebook's Kernel is using the camera and isn't stopped, it will continue to occupy this resource, preventing other notebooks from using it normally. Stopping the notebook's Kernel is necessary for others to function correctly.\n",
    "### Running Code Blocks\n",
    "After selecting the correct Kernel, you can run code blocks within the notebook. In JupyterLab, code blocks are fundamental components of a notebook. Here's how to execute them:\n",
    "- Run a Single Code Block: Select the code block you wish to run and click the \"â–¶ï¸Ž\" button on the toolbar or use the Shift + Enter shortcut. This action will execute the current code block and select the next one.\n",
