    "# Python Chassis Motion Contral\n",

    "In this chapter, we'll craft a Python routine for controlling the motion of a robot's chassis. This approach can be adapted to other programming languages for similar motion control tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Control Mechanism Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilize code blocks within JupyterLab to compose JSON commands. These commands are then dispatched to the microcontroller via the GPIO serial port on a Jetson (the default baud rate for communication with the microcontroller is 115200). Upon receiving these commands, the microcontroller executes the specified actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further sections will delve into the variety of commands that can be sent to the microcontroller. Alternatively, you might choose to implement these functionalities in a different programming language or develop a dedicated application for the controlling system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Adopting a master-slave architecture significantly liberates the resources of the master device. In this setup, the master device (such as a Raspberry Pi or Jetson SBC) acts as the brain, while the ESP32 microcontroller serves as a cerebellum-like entity handling the lower-level motion controls. This division of labor allows the master device to focus on high-level tasks like vision processing and decision-making, while the microcontroller efficiently manages precise movement control and other low-level tasks. Such an arrangement ensures that the microcontroller can maintain accurate wheel rotation speeds through high-frequency PID control, without overburdening the master device with computationally intensive tasks."

    "By invoking the code block mentioned above, the Jetson will initially send the command {\"T\":1,\"L\":0.2,\"R\":0.2} (the structure of commands will be discussed in more detail in later chapters). This command starts the wheels turning. After a two-second interval, the Jetson will send another command {\"T\":1,\"L\":0,\"R\":0}, causing the wheels to stop. It's important to note that even if the command to stop the wheels isn't sent, the wheels will still cease turning if no new commands are issued. This is due to a heartbeat function built into the subordinate machine. The purpose of this heartbeat function is to halt the current motion command automatically if the master control hasn't sent any new commands to the subordinate machine for an extended period. This function is designed to prevent continuous motion of the subordinate machine in case the master control encounters a problem that leads to a freeze or crash.\r",

    "You may find that the direction or speed of the robot's wheels does not meet your expectations after inputting the motion control commands above. This is because, before controlling the chassis, you need to set the chassis type. Each time the main program app.py is executed, the chassis type is automatically configured, and the configuration parameters are stored in config.yaml. Only then will the chassis be controlled by the correct parameters (by default, the chassis needs to be configured by the host computer every time it is powered up again). You can send the following commands to the chassis to set its type:\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the value of \"main\" represents the chassis type:\n",
    "- 1: RaspRover (four-wheel drive chassis)\n",

    "The value of \"module\" represents the module type:\n",
    "- 0: No module installed, or installed with a gimbal module\n",
    "- 1: Mechanical arm module (if the mechanical arm is not installed, it will cause the chassis to fail to ping the joint)\n",
    "- 2: Gimbal module (if the gimbal is not installed, it will cause the chassis to fail to ping the joint)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you are using a UGV Rover product with a gimbal installed, you can set the chassis type by sending the following command to the microcontroller:\n",
    "> {\"T\":900,\"main\":2,\"module\":0} or {\"T\":900,\"main\":2,\"module\":2}\n",
    "> Both of the above commands can be used to configure the UGV Rover product with a gimbal. If you do not need the chassis to provide feedback on the gimbal's angle information (only for user's secondary development, not included in the example routines), it is recommended to use the former.n"

    "The earlier routine allows you to make the robot move forward for two seconds before stopping. Further adjustments to the parameters can control the direction of the chassis, based on the differential steering principle. \n",
    "\n",
    "When turning, the inner wheels (on the side towards which the turn is made) travel a shorter distance and thus should rotate slower to maintain stability. The differential gear system achieves this by allowing the drive wheels to rotate at different speeds. Usually, the outer wheels (on the opposite side of the turn) rotate faster than the inner wheels. This variation in speed results in the turning motion of the vehicle, allowing it to steer in the intended direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control the vehicle's steering by assigning different target linear velocities to each wheel, thus achieving maneuverability and easily adjustable turning radii."
