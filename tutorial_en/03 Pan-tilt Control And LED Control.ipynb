    "## LED Control\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "The WAVE ROVER and UGV series products feature a drive board integrated with two 12V switches (the actual maximum voltage varies with the battery voltage). These switches are controlled by ESP32's IO4 and IO5 pins via MOS tubes. Each switch has two ports, totaling 4x 12V switch control ports. By default, IO4 controls the chassis LED (WAVE ROVER does not have a chassis LED), and IO5 controls the LED. You can control the switching of these two switches and adjust the voltage level by sending the corresponding commands to the slave computer. However, due to the inherent delay in MOSFET control, there may not be a linear relationship between the PWM output from the ESP32's IO and the actual voltage output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For products without LEDs, you can expand the 12.6V withstand LED on these two 12V switches (in general, 12V withstand is also acceptable for safety and battery protection, the product's UPS will not charge the battery above 12V). You can also expand other peripherals on the remaining switch control interfaces, such as a 12V withstand water gun gearbox, which can be directly connected to the interface controlled by IO5 to achieve automatic aiming and shooting functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code within the code block, you can select the desired code block and then press Ctrl+Enter to run the program. If you are using JupyterLab on a mobile device or tablet, you can press the play button above the code block to run it."

The variable IO4_PWM represents the PWM output of ESP32's IO4 pin, ranging from 0 to 255. When this variable is 0, the switch controlled by IO4 is turned off; when this variable is 255, the voltage output of the switch controlled by IO4 is close to the UPS BAT voltage (the current voltage of the three lithium batteries connected in series inside the UPS).\n",
