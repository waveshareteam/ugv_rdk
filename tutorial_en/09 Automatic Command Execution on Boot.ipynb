    "# Automatic Command Execution on Boot\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is aimed at demonstrating how the main control unit automatically executes specific commands and communicates instructions to the subordinate device each time the system boots. The code blocks in this chapter are for comprehension only and are not executable. They serve to elucidate the automatic processes that the product undertakes upon startup. Should you find the need, these commands are subject to modification or expansion.\n",
