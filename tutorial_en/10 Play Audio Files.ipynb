    "Due to security reasons, you cannot directly access the audio device through JupyterLab (environment limitations). The code blocks provided here are not meant for user execution.\n",

    "## Audio-related Functionality in the Product Main Program\n",
    "Inside the folder of the product's main program, there is a folder named \"sounds\", which contains many subfolders: connected, others, recv_new_cmd, robot_started, searching_for_target, target_detected, target_locked.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the default program provided, only one audio file is placed in each of the connected and robot_started subfolders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the robot's main program starts running, it will automatically play a random audio file from the robot_started folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a client connects to this web application using a browser, a random audio file from the connected folder will be played automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can place custom audio files in these folders as voice packs to customize your product further."
