    "# Image Transmission Based on Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces how to use Flask to create a web application for displaying real-time video from the robot's camera. Due to the cross-platform nature of web applications, users can watch the camera's real-time video on devices such as smartphones, PCs, tablets, etc., through a browser, achieving wireless image transmission functionality."

    "## What is Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight web application framework used to quickly build web applications using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework with a relatively small core library, but it offers enough flexibility and extensibility for developers to choose and add the extensions and libraries they need.\n",
    "- Simple and Easy to Use: Flask is designed to be simple and easy to use. Its API is clear and well-documented, allowing developers to quickly get started and build web applications rapidly.\n",
    "- Routing System: Flask uses decorators to define URL routes, mapping requests to corresponding handler functions. This makes creating different pages and handling different requests intuitive and straightforward.\n",
    "- Template Engine: Flask integrates with the Jinja2 template engine, making it easier to build dynamic content within the application. The template engine allows you to embed dynamically generated content in HTML.\n",
    "- Integrated Development Server: Flask comes with a simple integrated development server for easy development and debugging. However, in production environments, it is recommended to use more powerful web servers such as Gunicorn or uWSGI.\n",
    "- Plugins and Extensions: Flask supports many plugins and extensions for adding additional functionality, such as database integration, authentication, form handling, etc.\n",
    "- RESTful Support: Flask provides good support for RESTful-style APIs, making it simple to build and design RESTful APIs.\n",
    "- WSGI Compatibility: Flask is based on the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI), allowing it to run on many web servers that comply with the WSGI standard.\n",
    "- Active Community: Flask has a large and active community, meaning you can easily find extensive documentation, tutorials, third-party extensions, and support.d support."

    "Since the product automatically runs the main program at startup, which occupies the camera resource, this tutorial cannot be used in such situations. You need to terminate the main program or disable its automatic startup before restarting the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that because the robot's main program uses multi-threading and is configured to run automatically at startup through crontab, the usual method sudo killall python typically doesn't work. Therefore, we'll introduce the method of disabling the automatic startup of the main program here.\n",

    "1. Click the \"+\" icon next to the tab for this page to open a new tab called \"Launcher.\"\n",

The code is stored in the 12 folder within the `tutorial_cn` and `tutorial_en` directories. Inside the `12` folder, there is also a folder named `template` for storing web resources. Below are the steps to run the example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal using the method described earlier. Make sure the terminal's default path matches the file path on the left. Navigate to the 12 folder by entering `cd 12` in the terminal.\n",
    "2. Start the Flask web application server using the following command: `python flask_camera.py`.\n",
    "3. Open a web browser on a device within the same local network (or open a new tab in the browser on the same device) and enter the Raspberry Pi's IP address followed by :5000. For example, if the Raspberry Pi's IP address is `192.168.10.104`, enter `192.168.10.104:5000` in the browser's address bar. Note that : should be an English colon.\n",
