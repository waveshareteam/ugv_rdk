    "Since the product automatically runs the main program at startup, which occupies the camera resource, this tutorial cannot be used in such situations. You need to terminate the main program or disable its automatic startup before restarting the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that because the robot's main program uses multi-threading and is configured to run automatically at startup through crontab, the usual method sudo killall python typically doesn't work. Therefore, we'll introduce the method of disabling the automatic startup of the main program here.\n",

    "The face feature database file is located in the same path as this .ipynb file. You can change the faceCascade variable to modify what needs to be detected. You'll need to replace the current `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file with other feature files.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "When the code block runs successfully, you can position the robot's camera on a face, and the area containing the face will be automatically highlighted on the screen."
