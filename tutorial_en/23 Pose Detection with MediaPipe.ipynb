    "## What is MediaPipe?\r\n",
    "\n",
    "MediaPipe is an open-source framework developed by Google for building machine learning-based multimedia processing applications. It provides a set of tools and libraries for processing video, audio, and image data, and applies machine learning models to achieve various functionalities such as pose estimation, gesture recognition, and face detection. MediaPipe is designed to offer efficient, flexible, and easy-to-use solutions, enabling developers to quickly build a variety of multimedia processing applications."

    "Since the product automatically runs the main program at startup, which occupies the camera resource, this tutorial cannot be used in such situations. You need to terminate the main program or disable its automatic startup before restarting the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that because the robot's main program uses multi-threading and is configured to run automatically at startup through crontab, the usual method sudo killall python typically doesn't work. Therefore, we'll introduce the method of disabling the automatic startup of the main program here.\n",

    "1. Click the \"+\" icon next to the tab for this page to open a new tab called \"Launcher.\"\n",
    "2. Click on \"Terminal\" under \"Other\" to open a terminal window.\n",
    "3. Type bash into the terminal window and press Enter.\n",
    "4. Now you can use the Bash Shell to control the robot.\n",
    "5. Enter the command: `sudo killall -9 python`."
